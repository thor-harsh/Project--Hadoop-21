# Project--Hadoop-21

**In this Project we will be using Spark SQL to create a dataframe instead of RDD to count the average number of friends associated with each age group. Then we also sort the result by age and also added alias for that column**<br></br>

**Before diving into the project let's get to know about Spark**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark**?<br></br>
Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on Single-Node Machines or Clusters.<br></br>

**What is Spark SQL**?<br></br>
Spark SQL lets you query structured data inside Spark programs, using either SQL or a familiar DataFrame API. Usable in Java, Scala, Python and R.
Spark SQL supports the HiveQL syntax as well as Hive SerDes and UDFs, allowing you to access existing Hive warehouses.<br></br> DataFrames and SQL provide a common way to access a variety of data sources, including Hive, Avro, Parquet, ORC, JSON, and JDBC. You can even join data across these sources.<br></br>



**This dataset which we downloaded contains 4 columns:** <br></br>
 **(User-Id):** The id of the user <br></br>
 **(Name):** The name of the user <br></br>
 **(Age):** The age of the user <br></br>
 **(Friends):** The total number of friends <br></br>
 
 **Important Note: Go through the dataset before jumping to the code**<br></br>

 **So what are you waiting for..? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!**
